      <a class="invisible sypnosis">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third novel in the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. The story begins with Harry returning to Hogwarts for his third year, and soon learns that a dangerous prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped from the wizarding prison of Azkaban and is believed to be after him. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione investigate, they learn that Sirius Black is actually a close family friend and may have been falsely accused of a crime. Along the way, Harry discovers that his past and his family's past is more complex and dangerous than he ever imagined. He also discovers that the prison guards, Dementors, are stationed at Hogwarts to protect the students from Sirius Black, but their presence only makes the school feel more oppressive. As the story progresses, Harry learns about the mysterious "animagus" and "time-turner" and how they relate to Sirius Black, as well as more about his past and his connection to Lord Voldemort. The story ends with a thrilling climax in which Harry faces off against Sirius Black and learns the truth about his past and his family. The novel also introduces new characters such as Remus Lupin, a werewolf and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and Peter Pettigrew, an old friend of Harry's father who is believed to have betrayed and killed Harry's parents.</a>

Shortly after his arrival, strange things begin to happen at the school and students are attacked by an unknown creature.

      <a class="invisible sypnosis">A beautifully crafted story of forbidden love and changing social conventions, My Policeman follows three young people -- policeman Tom (Harry Styles), teacher Marion (Emma Corrin), and museum curator Patrick (David Dawson) -- as they embark on an emotional journey in 1950s Britain. Flashing forward to the 1990s, Tom (Linus Roache), Marion (Gina McKee), and Patrick (Rupert Everett) are still reeling with longing and regret, but now they have one last chance to repair the damage of the past. Based on the book by Bethan Roberts, director Michael Grandage carves a visually transporting, heart-stopping portrait of three people caught up in the shifting tides of history, liberty, and forgiveness. </a>

      <a class="invisible sypnosis">With his theatrical company a local success, Buster Moon is dreaming of
      bigger things. Unfortunately, when a talent scout dismisses their work as inadequate for the big time, Buster
      is
      driven to prove her wrong. With that goal in mind, Buster inspires his players to gamble everything to sneak
      into a talent audition in Redshore City for the demanding entertainment mogul Jimmy Crystal. Against the odds,
      they catch his interest with some frantic creative improvisation and even more desperate lies like personally
      knowing the reclusive rock star, Clay Calloway, who has not been seen in 15 years. Now faced with a tight
      production window with only a vague story idea and dire consequences for failure, Buster and his friends must
      all stretch their talents put on a show against all odds. In that struggle, the gang's challenges seem
      insurmountable, but each of them finds new inspirations and friends where they least expect them to pursue an
      artistic dream worthy of them.</a>

      <a class="invisible sypnosis">Seventeen-year-old Stella spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is
      full of routines, boundaries and self-control all of which get put to the test when she meets Will, an
      impossibly charming teen who has the same illness. There's an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate
      that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation
      to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction. Love has no boundaries.</a>
